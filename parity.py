### Part 1 of lab

## Part 1a
# Write a program (in any language, such as C, C++, Java, JavaScript, or Python)
# that generates a parity bit (even or odd - you choose)
# for each byte of data and verify its correct operation.*

## Part 1b
# Write another program to detect correct data based on the parity you have defined.
# Then use the program to generate a byte of data along with the parity bit (9-bits total),
# and observe what happens when there are 0, 1, 2, or 3 bits in error in a given byte.
# Include a screenshot of the results (command line or other) and discuss the probability of an undetected error occurring.
