### Part 2 of lab

## Part 2a
# *Write a program that generates an 8-bit CRC checksum for a data stream.
# An example of this program follows, in pseudocode.
# This same program may be used to check correct reception of the data stream.
# The simplest data stream for which this may be used is two bytes;
# simulate at least 5 different 2-byte data streams both with and without errors and log the results.
# Particularly interesting are error data streams which differ by only 1 bit from the correct data.

## Part 2b
# Also, simulate at least one 32-byte data stream with at least one error and log the results.
# Include a screenshot of the results and discuss the probability of an undetected error occurring
